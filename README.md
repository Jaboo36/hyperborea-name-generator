# hyperborea-name-generator
A random name generator for the OSR TTRPG Hyperborea, authored by Jefferey P. Talanian.

To use the generator, make sure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) installed on your computer.

- Run `java -jar .\name_of_the_jar.jar` in the terminal to start the program.
  
  - Example: `java -jar .\HyperboreaNameGenerator-1.2.jar`
    
  - if you are using Windows use a '\' for the file name. If you are using Mac or Linux use a '/' instead.
    
- The results will be put in a text file called 'generatedNames.txt' in the same directory as the jar file.

- The previously generated file will be renamed to 'OLD_generatedNames.txt' and will remain until the next time the program is run.
